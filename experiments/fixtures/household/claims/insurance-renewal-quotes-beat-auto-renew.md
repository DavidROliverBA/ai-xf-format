# Claim

Every year on the household's price log, at least one comparison quote has
undercut the incumbent insurer's auto-renewal price, usually by shopping
around six weeks ahead of the renewal date.[^renewal-price-log] The sample is
small and the margin varies year to year — hence the low confidence — but it
is the case behind the
[insurance renewal runbook](../concepts/insurance-renewal.md) always
comparing quotes rather than letting the policy auto-renew.
