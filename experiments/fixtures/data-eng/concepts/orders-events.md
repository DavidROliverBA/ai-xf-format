# Overview

The orders event stream is derived from the [orders table](./orders-table.md):
every insert or update to that table emits an event onto this
topic.[^orders-events-design] Consumers subscribe instead of polling the
table directly.

# Consumers

The payments bundle's [payment service v2](https://internal.example.com/services/payment-v2)
depends on this stream to compute capture amounts asynchronously, replacing
its predecessor's synchronous read of the orders table. That dependency is
declared on the payments side as a federation-qualified `depends-on:
data-eng/orders-events`; this concept declares the inverse `depended-on-by`
edge back to `example-payments/payment-service-v2`.
