# Schema

Data engineering owns this table's schema. It is the source of writes; reads
happen either directly or via the [orders event stream](./orders-events.md),
which is source-of by this table.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `order_id` | STRING | Globally unique order identifier. |
| `customer_id` | STRING | Foreign key to the customer. |
| `total` | NUMERIC | Order total in minor units. |
| `status` | STRING | Order lifecycle state. |

# Relationship to the payments bundle's copy

The [payments bundle also describes an `orders-table` concept](https://internal.example.com/data/orders)
under its own id — same physical table, different bundle, same id string.
That copy documents the table from the consumer side (what the payment
service reads); this concept is the schema owner's side. The two ids
collide deliberately and are not linked as the same concept — they are
cross-referenced (`relates-to`) so a federation consumer can tell they
describe the same table without merging the two records.

# Verification

Verified by an automated schema checker, not yet by a human reviewer —
machine-confirmed trust tier.
