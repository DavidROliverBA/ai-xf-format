# Policy

Order records in the [orders table](./orders-table.md) are retained for
seven years for tax purposes; customer records in the
[customers table](./customers.md) are retained for the lifetime of the
account plus two years, per the data retention standard.[^data-retention-standard]

# Disaster recovery

The policy currently assumes recovery of either table happens via a nightly
batch backfill job. See the open contradiction against
[event replay is cheaper than backfill](../claims/event-replay-is-cheaper-than-backfill.md),
which questions that assumption for the orders table specifically.
