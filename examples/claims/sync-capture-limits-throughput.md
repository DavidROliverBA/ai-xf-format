# Claim

Each capture blocks on a read of the orders table, so
[payment service](../concepts/payment-service.md) throughput cannot exceed what
the orders database serves synchronously.[^payments-runbook] Peak-hour queueing
in Q2 was attributed to this coupling.[^q2-capacity-review]

This is the argument for [payment service v2](../concepts/payment-service-v2.md).
