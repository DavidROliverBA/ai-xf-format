# Claim

Under the September load test the orders database ran at 40% utilisation while
capture latency still degraded.[^sept-load-test] The limit therefore sits
elsewhere, most likely in the acquirer connection pool.

This contradicts the claim that
[synchronous capture limits throughput](./sync-capture-limits-throughput.md).
The curator agent recorded the disagreement and left both claims intact; it did
not rewrite either one. The contradiction stays `open` until a person rules.
