# Overview

Payment service v2 supersedes the original [payment service](./payment-service.md)
with an event-driven capture flow. It still depends on the
[orders table](./orders-table.md) but consumes it asynchronously, via the
orders event stream owned by the data engineering team's bundle.

Authored by [Jane Doe](../people/jane-doe.md).

# Status

In build. `verified` is absent (unverified tier) until the capture
reconciliation tests pass and a human signs off.
