# Overview

The payment service authorises and captures customer payments. It depends on the
[orders table](./orders-table.md) to compute capture amounts and is being
replaced by [payment service v2](./payment-service-v2.md).

Maintained by [Jane Doe](../people/jane-doe.md).

# Notes

Capture is currently synchronous.[^payments-runbook] Whether that is what limits
throughput is disputed: see the claim that
[synchronous capture limits throughput](../claims/sync-capture-limits-throughput.md)
and the open contradiction recorded against it.
